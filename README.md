# Cordova-ExpensesApp

This is a simple cordova app to make list of expenses, instead of keeping them in mind you can just add that in this app.

This works only for Android!

First you need to enter the initial amount you have and subsequently add the expenses to the list.Doing this you will have the entire list of expenses, also you will have the closing amount after the expenses.

Check the screenshots to understand it better.

After you download the project,Open the folder and type "npm install" from command prompt.All the dependent node modules will be installed and that's all the app works..!

If anything goes wrong checkout the link mentioned above. You want to directly use the .apk file and start using the app then download just the .apk file and install it on android mobiles and start using it.
