# Cordova-ExpensesApp

This is a simple cordova app to make list of expenses, instead of keeping them in mind you can just add that in this app.

First you need to enter the initial amount you have and subsequently add the expenses to the list.Doing this you will have the entire list of expenses, also you will have the closing amount after the expenses.

Check the screenshots to understand it better.

After you download the project,Open the folder and type "npm install" from command prompt.All the dependent node modules will be installed and that's all the app works..!
